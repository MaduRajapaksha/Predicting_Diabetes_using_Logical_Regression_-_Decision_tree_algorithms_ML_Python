# Predicting_Diabetes_using_Logical_Regression_-_Decision_tree_algorithms_ML_Python
Logistic Regression is one of the most simple and commonly used Machine Learning algorithms for two-class classification. It describes and estimates the relationship between one dependent binary variable and independent variables. Linear regression gives you a continuous output, but logistic regression provides a constant output. The logistic function is a sigmoid function, which takes any real value between zero and one.
